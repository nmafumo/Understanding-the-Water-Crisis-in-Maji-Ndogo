# Understanding-the-Water-Crisis-in-Maji-Ndogo

This project aims to address the pressing issue of water scarcity in Maji Ndogo.Maji Ndogo, a fictional country that mirrors real-world challenges.To achieve this goal, we have analyzed a comprehensive dataset of 60,000 records. By employing a rigorous data-driven approach, we seek to gain valuable insights into the root causes of the crisis and identify potential solutions. 

We used two distinct approaches to address this problem: SQL for data analysis and Power BI for visualisation 

## Phase 1: Data Analysis with SQL

Data Exploration and Cleaning (Part 1):

Familiarization with the Maji Ndogo water data across various tables (60,000 records).
Employing basic SQL queries to understand data structure and content.
Data refinement using Data Manipulation Language (DML).

Deep Dive Analysis (Part 2):

Breaking down the scope of the problem
Creating hypothesis
Utilising advanced SQL functions, including window functions, to extract insights from water-related data tables e.g (water collection queues)

Impact Assessment (Part 3):

Creating an ERD to understand the relationship of the tables
Joining tables to find duplicates in the data 
Linking tables to find discrepancies: numerous visits to locations, reports of potential fraud

Final Analysis (Part 4):
Finding a practical solution to implement
Creating a table for engineers to update when work has been done on a particular project

## Phase 2: Visualization with Power BI

Data Exploration and Initial Visuals (Part 1):

Introduction to updated data: gender composition in water queues and new crime data.
Creating basic visualisations to explore crime data and gender disparity regarding water access.
Focusing on visualising results from a national survey for future reporting.

Data Modeling and Refinement (Part 2):

Importing tables, cleaning data, and establishing a functional data model in Power BI.
Rebuilding visualizations based on the new data model and analysing its impact.
Refining visuals with customized text, colors, and fonts for clarity and simplicity.

National Survey Report Finalization (Part 3):

Utilizing DAX functions to create measures and columns for enriched data representation on the dashboard.

Public Dashboard for Transparency (Part 4):

Building a public dashboard to track project financials with transparency.
Monitoring budget allocation versus project completion and flagging potential discrepancies for accountability.
